# Jessica's Website Style Guide

Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As my websites have grown larger and more complex, I have learned that having a consistent set of styles helps them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users!
